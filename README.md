# Overview
Re-Rail is a cutting-edge predictive maintenance system designed to ensure the safety and reliability of railway infrastructure. By leveraging AI-powered visual inspection and GPS technology, it provides monitoring defect detection and monitoring for train tracks, significantly reducing the risk of undetected rail defects and enabling proactive maintenance.

# Key Features
- Proactive and automated detection reduces manual monitoring efforts
- Enhances safety, cost-efficiency, and environmental stewardship
- Supports sustainable development goals by improving public transport reliability and safety

# How It Works 
## 1. Smart Device on Trains:
  A compact device is mounted on trains. This device includes:
- A camera that captures images of the tracks at regular intervals
- A GPS module that records the exact location of each image

## 2. Centralized Processing:
- The images and location data are sent to a central server.
- An AI-powered model(YOLO V10) analyzes the images to detect defects like cracks or wear.
- send all this information to a clicable map-based UI

 ## 3. Real-Time Insights:
- Maintenance teams can view the detected issues on an interactive map-based UI.
- This allows them to easily locate problem areas and plan repairs efficiently.
